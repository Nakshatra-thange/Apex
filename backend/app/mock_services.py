# **Action 2: Test the Full Pipeline**

# 1.  **Ensure Everything is Running:**
#     * **Terminal 1:** Your FastAPI server (`uvicorn app.main:app --reload`).
#     * **Terminal 2:** Your ARQ worker (`arq app.worker.WorkerSettings`).
#     * **Docker:** Your containers (`docker-compose up -d`).

# 2.  **Use a `low_quality_test.py` snippet** (the one with bad naming and missing docstrings) for this test, as it will give the AI good context.

# 3.  **Submit the Snippet for Review:**
#     * Go through the full process in your API docs: log in, create a project, upload the `low_quality_test.py` file, and finally execute the `POST .../review` endpoint.

# 4.  **Observe the Worker Log and Database:**

#     * **Worker Terminal:** You will see the pipeline run. The most important log will be from the `openai_client`, which will now be sending a much more detailed prompt.
#     * **Database Verification (The Definitive Proof):**
#         * Open your database GUI and find the `results` column for the new review.
#         * **Expected Result:** The `ai_summary` field in the JSON will now be an **object** containing the `summary` and `key_suggestions`, not just a simple string.

#     **Expected JSON in the `results` column:**
#     ```json
#     {
#       "ai_summary": {
#         "summary": "[MOCK FALLBACK] The code appears functional but has several areas for improvement...",
#         "key_suggestions": [
#           "Refactor the nested loop to reduce algorithmic complexity.",
#           "Consider using a more descriptive variable name...",
#           "Add missing docstrings..."
#         ]
#       },
#       "security_report": { ... },
#       "performance_report": { ... },
#       "quality_report": { ... },
#       "code_metrics": { ... }
#     }
